E
I'm scratching at the surface now

C#m
And I'm trying hard to work it out

E
So much has gone misunderstood

C#m
This mystery only leads to doubt

F#m
And I didn't understand

Abm                                 Am
When you reached out to take my hand

Abm                          F#m
And if you have something to say

B
You'd better say it now



E                         Abm
Cause this is what you've waited for
C#m                        A
Your chance to even up the score
E                Abm           C#m
And as these shadows fall on me now
A
I will somehow


E                              Abm
Cause I'm picking up a message Lord
C#m                               A
And I'm closer than I've ever been before


E                          B                  A
So if you have something to say Say it to me now
B              A
Say it to me now
B              A
Say it to me now </textarea>
